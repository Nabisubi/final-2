# Loan Eligibility Prediction
## In this repository is my go on predicting loan Eligibility using a dataset from kaggle, using python, using decision Tree Classifier, naive_Bayes and Random Forests from Scikit-Learn.
The dataset had a lot of Current Loans which were not very helping in predicting  and a few in Grace Period.
Fortunately my accuracy_score turned out to be very good.
